Question:

String Split
Description
Split the string input_str = 'Kumar_Ravi_003' to the person's second name, first name and unique customer code. In this example, second_name= 'Kumar', first_name= 'Ravi', customer_code = '003'.

A sample output of the input 'Kumar_Ravi_003' is:
Ravi
Kumar
003
 
Note that you need to print in the order first name, last name and customer code.

Ans: 
import ast,sys
input_str = sys.stdin.read()
first_name = input_str[6:10]
second_name = input_str[:5]
customer_code = input_str[11:]
print(first_name)
print(second_name)
print(customer_code)

Assignment 1: 
Description
In a school, there are total 20 students numbered from 1 to 20. You’re given three lists named ‘C’, ‘F’, and ‘H’, representing students who play cricket, football, and hockey, respectively. Based on this information, find out and print the following: 
1.	Students who play all the three sports
2.	Students who play both cricket and football but don’t play hockey
3.	Students who play exactly two of the sports
4.	Students who don’t play any of the three sports
Format:
Input:
3 lists containing numbers (ranging from 1 to 20) representing students who play cricket, football and hockey respectively.
Output:
4 different lists containing the students according to the constraints provided in the questions.

Note: Make sure you sort the final lists (in an ascending order) that you get before printing them; otherwise your answer might not match the test-cases.

Examples:
Input 1:
[2, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
[2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16]
[1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15]
Output 1:
[2, 5, 9, 13]
[16]
[12, 15, 16]
[3, 8, 14, 20]

Explanation:
1.Given the three sets, you can see that the students numbered '2', '5', '9', and '13' play all the three sports. 
2. The student numbered '16' plays cricket and football but doesn't play hockey. 
3. The student numbered '12' and '15' plays cricket and hockey and the student numbered '16' plays cricket and football. There are no students who play only football and hockey. Hence, the students who play exactly two sports are 12, 15, and 16.
4. As you can see, the students who play none of the sports are 3, 8, 14, and 20.

Input
[[2, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16], [1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15]]
Expected output
[2, 5, 9, 13]
[16]
[12, 15, 16]
[3, 8, 14, 20]

Solution :
# Convert the given lists to sets as it is easier to perform the given operations
# on sets
C = set(input_list[0])
F = set(input_list[1])
H = set(input_list[2])

# Perform an '&' operation between the three sets to find out the students who play
# all the three sports. Finally, convert it into a list, apply the sorted() function
# and print the resultant list.
print(sorted(list(C & F & H)))

# The following opeartion gives the students who play only Cricket and Football.
# Note that only (C & F) also contains the students who play all the three sports
# and hence, we need to subtract (C & F & H) from it.
print(sorted(list((C & F) - (C & F & H))))

# The students who play exactly three sports can be given by the following expression
# (C & F) gives the students who play cricket and football, (F & H) gives the students
# who play football and hockey, and (F & H) gives the students who play cricket and
# hockey. Performing an 'OR' operation ('|') between the three will give the students
# who play a minimum of two sports and finally subracting (C & F & H) will give the 
# list of students who play exactly two sports.
print(sorted(list(((C & F) | (F & H) | (C & H)) - (C & F & H))))

# As the students are numbered from 1 to 20, the whole set of students can be defined
# by creating a set containing all the numbers from 1 to 20, using range. Finally,
# you can subract (C | F | H), from the created set to get all the students who don't
# play even a single sport.
print(sorted(list(set(range(1,21)) - (C | F | H))))

Assignment 2:
Factorial
Description
Given a number ‘n’, output its factorial using reduce().
Note: Make sure you handle the edge case of zero. As you know, 0! = 1

P.S.: Finding the factorial without using the reduce() function might lead to deduction of marks.

Examples:
Input 1:
1
Output 1:
1

Input 2:
3
Output 2:
6

Solution:
# Read the input as an integer
n = int(input())

# Import the reduce() function
from functools import reduce

# If n is zero, simply print 1 as this case can't be handles by reduce()
if n==0:
    print(1)

# In all other cases, use reduce() between the range 1 and (n+1). For this range,
# define a lambda function with x and y and keep multiplying them using reduce().
# This way, when the code reaches the end of the range, i.e. n, the factorial
# computation will be complete.
else:
    print(reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(1, n+1)))
